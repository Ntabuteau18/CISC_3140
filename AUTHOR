Hello, my name is Naldy Tabuteau and I am currently a senior at Brooklyn
College. I am currently a computer science major and learning different 
programming techniques and hope to earn a position working with gaming
software or hardware. Some of my hobbies include music, exercising, and playing
games with friends. This is my first time using programs and learning about
ssh and properly using a terminal so I am excited to learn more.

This is the instruction set for operating the awk script for the ranking of the cars in the data_lab1
submodule. The instructions are for you to run the awk command from your command
line and make sure that your data.csv file is in place. Your data.csv will be 
ran and the output of the car rankings will be placed into a seperate file known
as Output. The output will contain the necessary fields relating to the cars and the
total amount of the columns which determine their rankings at the last column
